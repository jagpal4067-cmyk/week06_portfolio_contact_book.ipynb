1 Weekly Exercise: Show Me Your Process
What You Submit: Just Steps 1, 2, and 3 for two problems. NO CODE.

This week is about proving you can THINK about a problem before jumping to AI or code.

1.1 Problem 1: Tip Calculator
1.1.1 The Scenario
You work at a Perth restaurant. The manager wants a simple tool where staff can enter: - The bill amount (e.g., $45.80) - The tip percentage (e.g., 15%)

And get back: - The tip amount - The total amount to charge

1.1.2 What You Must Submit
STEP 1: Understand the Problem

In your own words, what is this program supposed to do? (2-3 sentences)

[Your answer here]

STEP 2: Identify Inputs and Outputs

INPUTS: - [What does the user provide?] - [What type of data? Numbers? Text?]

OUTPUTS: - [What does the program show back?] - [What format?]

STEP 3: Work It By Hand

Show me you can do this with a calculator. Use this example: - Bill amount: $45.80 - Tip percentage: 15%

Write the steps: 1. [First calculation I would do] 2. [Second calculation] 3. [Final step] 4. [What I would tell the staff member]

1.2 Problem 2: Late Fee Calculator
1.2.1 The Scenario
You work for a library in Perth. Books are due back in 14 days. For every day late, there’s a $0.50 fine (maximum $10.00).

The librarian wants a program where they enter: - How many days the book is overdue

And get back: - The fine amount (or “Maximum fine reached” if it’s over $10)

1.2.2 What You Must Submit
STEP 1: Understand the Problem

In your own words, what is this program supposed to do? (2-3 sentences)

[Your answer here]

STEP 2: Identify Inputs and Outputs

INPUTS: - [What information does the librarian provide?]

OUTPUTS: - [What does the program calculate and show?] - [Any special cases?]

STEP 3: Work It By Hand

Show me you understand the logic. Calculate these three cases manually:

Case A: Book is 5 days late - My calculation: [Show your work] - Fine: [Answer]

Case B: Book is 25 days late - My calculation: [Show your work] - Fine: [Answer] - Special note: [Why is this different?]

Case C: Book is 0 days late - Fine: [Answer]

1.3 Submission Requirements
Create a Google Colab notebook
Use markdown cells to answer all the questions above
Export your AI conversation (if you used AI to check your thinking)
Save as AI_conversation.txt
Add to your GitHub repo
Save to GitHub with commit message: “Week 10 - Process documentation”
NO CODE REQUIRED

1.3.1 About Using AI
You SHOULD use AI to: - Check if your manual calculations are correct - Verify your understanding of the problem - Ask “did I identify all the inputs?”

But your submitted answers must be in YOUR words, showing YOUR thinking.

1.4 Marking
Each problem is marked Complete/Incomplete:

Complete: All three steps answered with genuine effort + AI conversation file in repo (if used)
Incomplete: Missing steps, one-word answers, or no evidence of checking work
Marking time per student: ~1 minute (just check they have answers and conversation file)

1.5 What I’m Looking For
✅ Good Answer (Step 1): “This program helps restaurant staff calculate tips quickly. They type in the bill amount and what percentage tip they want to add, and the program tells them the tip amount and the new total.”

❌ Lazy Answer: “Calculate tips.”

✅ Good Answer (Step 3 - Tip Calculator): 1. Take $45.80 and multiply by 0.15 to get the tip: $6.87 2. Add $6.87 to $45.80 to get the total: $52.67 3. Tell the staff member: “Tip is $6.87, total charge is $52.67”

❌ Lazy Answer: “Calculate 15% and add it.”

1.6 Why No Code This Week?
Because I’m testing whether you can THINK about problems, not whether you can get AI to write code for you.

If you can’t do Steps 1-3, then you don’t understand the problem well enough to use AI effectively anyway.

Next week: You’ll take ONE of these problems through to Step 6 with AI help. But only if you prove you understand it first. hi help me explain me what i have to do in this one 
ChatGPT said:

No worries — this task looks long, but it’s actually simple once you break it down 😊

Here’s exactly what you have to do step by step 👇

🧭 OVERVIEW

This week’s exercise is not about coding.
You only need to show your thinking process for two small problems — a Tip Calculator and a Late Fee Calculator.

You’ll complete Steps 1, 2, and 3 for both problems (so, six short sections total).
Everything goes in a Google Colab notebook using Markdown cells (text cells) — NO code at all.

🧩 WHAT TO DO (Step-by-Step)
🔹 Problem 1: Tip Calculator
STEP 1: Understand the Problem

Write 2–3 sentences in your own words describing what the program does.
Example:

This program helps restaurant staff quickly calculate a customer’s tip. They enter the bill amount and the tip percentage, and it tells them how much the tip is and what the total bill will be.

STEP 2: Identify Inputs and Outputs

List:

What information the user provides (inputs)

What the program shows (outputs)

Example:

INPUTS:

Bill amount (a number, e.g., 45.80)

Tip percentage (a number, e.g., 15)

OUTPUTS:

Tip amount (in dollars)

Total bill (bill + tip)

STEP 3: Work It by Hand

Manually calculate the result for the example they gave:

Bill = $45.80
Tip = 15%

Example answer:

Multiply 45.80 × 0.15 = 6.87 → this is the tip.

Add 45.80 + 6.87 = 52.67 → this is the total.

Tell staff: “Tip is $6.87, total to charge is $52.67.”

🔹 Problem 2: Late Fee Calculator
STEP 1: Understand the Problem

Write 2–3 sentences about what this program does.

Example:

This program calculates how much a library fine should be when a book is returned late. The librarian enters how many days overdue it is, and the program shows the fine — up to a maximum of $10.

STEP 2: Identify Inputs and Outputs

INPUTS:

Number of days overdue (whole number)

OUTPUTS:

Fine amount in dollars

Or message “Maximum fine reached” if the fine is over $10

STEP 3: Work It by Hand

They give you three cases — you show your manual calculation for each.

Case A: 5 days late
5 × $0.50 = $2.50 → Fine: $2.50

Case B: 25 days late
25 × $0.50 = $12.50, but the maximum fine is $10 → Fine: $10.00
Special note: Fine is capped at $10, even though calculation gives $12.50.

Case C: 0 days late
Fine: $0.00

📁 WHAT TO SUBMIT

Would you like me to give you a filled-in example (you can use it as a model for your notebook)?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👍 — here’s a complete example you can copy into your Google Colab notebook.
Just make sure to reword some parts in your own style (your teacher wants to see your thinking, not copy-paste text).

📝 Week 10 - Process Documentation
💡 Problem 1: Tip Calculator
Step 1: Understand the Problem

This program helps restaurant staff quickly figure out how much a customer should pay including a tip. The user enters the total bill amount and the tip percentage. The program then calculates the tip value and adds it to the bill to show the total amount to charge.

Step 2: Identify Inputs and Outputs

INPUTS:

Bill amount (number, e.g., 45.80)

Tip percentage (number, e.g., 15)

OUTPUTS:

Tip amount (dollar value, e.g., $6.87)

Total amount including tip (dollar value, e.g., $52.67)

Step 3: Work It by Hand

Example:
Bill = $45.80
Tip = 15%

Steps:

Multiply the bill by the tip percentage:
45.80 × 0.15 = 6.87 → this is the tip amount.

Add the tip to the bill:
45.80 + 6.87 = 52.67 → this is the total.

What I’d tell the staff:
“The tip is $6.87 and the total to charge is $52.67.”

📚 Problem 2: Late Fee Calculator
Step 1: Understand the Problem

This program helps a librarian calculate how much to fine someone for returning a book late. The librarian types in how many days overdue the book is. The program multiplies that by $0.50 per day, but if the fine is more than $10, it stops at $10.

Step 2: Identify Inputs and Outputs

INPUTS:

Number of days overdue (integer, e.g., 5)

OUTPUTS:

Fine amount (in dollars)

OR message: “Maximum fine reached” (if fine exceeds $10)

Step 3: Work It by Hand

Case A: Book is 5 days late

Fine = 5 × $0.50 = $2.50

Fine is under $10 → no cap applied.
Answer: $2.50

Case B: Book is 25 days late

Fine = 25 × $0.50 = $12.50

Fine is above $10, so cap it at $10.
Answer: $10.00
Special note: The fine doesn’t increase after 20 days because the maximum fine limit is reached.

Case C: Book is 0 days late

Fine = 0 × $0.50 = $0.00
Answer: $0.00

✅ That’s it!

Would you like me to show you how to split it into multiple text cells (for example: one cell for Problem 1, one for Problem 2) so it’s easier to edit later?

You said:
does i need to give any code in it
ChatGPT said:

Excellent question — and the answer is ❌ NO — absolutely no code this week! 🙅‍♂️

Here’s the key point your teacher made:

“This week is about proving you can THINK about a problem before jumping to AI or code.”

✅ What You DO Include

Only Steps 1, 2, and 3 for each problem — written in plain English.
So just:

Short explanations (2–3 sentences)

Lists of inputs and outputs

Manual calculations (you can use numbers and symbols like ×, +, etc.)

Everything goes inside text (Markdown) cells — not code cells.

🚫 What You DO NOT Include

No Python code

No print() statements

No calculations done by code

No formulas written like code (tip = bill * 0.15)

💡 Why?

Your instructor is testing:

Can you explain the logic clearly?

Do you understand inputs, outputs, and manual steps?

Can you reason about the problem without using code or AI?

Next week, you’ll actually write the code — but only after you’ve shown that you understand the process.

So for now, keep your Google Colab notebook 100% text ✅
If you see a grey “code box” appear — delete it.
Use only the “+ Text” button.

Would you like me to show you exactly what your finished Colab page should look like (layout example, with one text cell per section)?
